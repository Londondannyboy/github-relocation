But in the absence of a will, inheritance is handled by Islamic Shari’a law.\n\n### Capital Gains Tax\n\nUnless they are obtained from sales of a corporation that is required to pay income tax or banking tax, capital gains are generally exempt from taxation in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n## Dual Citizenship UAE\n\nAccording to the new citizenship law in the UAE, those who are granted UAE citizenship will be allowed to keep their existing citizenship. Thereby the UAE allows for dual citizenship, you just need to check with your country of origin.\n\n## Renewal of The UAE Golden Visa\n\nAfter you get your UAE Golden Visa, it will be valid for 10 years.
