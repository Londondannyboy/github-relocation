During this period, they are required to convert their temporary visa into a residency permit. There are no age or nationality restrictions for Golden visa applications.\n\n![DIFC, Dubai’s key business centre for trade.](https://www.investindubai.gov.ae/en/live-and-work/visas-and-entry/residency-for-investors-and-entrepreneurs.)\n\n## Golden visa eligibility\n\nExplore the requirements and eligibility criteria for investors and entrepreneurs to apply for the UAE Golden visa:\n\n### 5-year visa for property investors:\n\nGranting a visa is subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe investor must invest in a property of a gross value of not less than AED2 million (approx.
