const keywordData = await dataForSEO.searchVolume({
  keywords: ['exit tax usa', 'form 8854'],
  location: 'US'
});

// 2. Find trending topics with WebSearch
const trends = await webSearch({
  query: 'new visa programs 2025',

  'https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8854.pdf',
  'https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Renunciation-US-Nationality.html'
]);

// Parse PDFs for exact requirements
const pdfContent = await firecrawl.parsePDF({
  url: 'irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8854.pdf',
  extractTables: true,
  extractForms: true
});
```

#### Step 3: Current Updates with Tavily
