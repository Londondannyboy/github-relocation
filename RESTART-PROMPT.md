**YOUR MISSION:**
Generate the next 10 HIGH-QUALITY articles using the FULL enhanced pipeline:

1. **USE ALL RESEARCH APIs:**
   - Serper.dev ($0.0003) - Get top 10 competitors for EVERY article
   - Tavily (FREE) - Research 5 questions per article
   - LinkUp (Fallback) - If Tavily fails (ID: 55ae9876-ffe4-4ee3-92b0-cb3c43ba280f)
   - Firecrawl ($0.05) - Scrape top 3 competitors (CACHE EVERYTHING!)
   - DataForSEO - Only for Tier 1 keywords

2. **GENERATE 2000+ WORD ARTICLES:**

   - Generate 2-3 images per article

3. **IMPLEMENT SMART CACHING:**
   ```javascript
   const cache = {};
   async function withCache(key, fetchFn) {
     if (cache[key]) return cache[key];
     const data = await fetchFn();
     cache[key] = data;
     return data;
   }
   ```

4. **QUALITY VALIDATION:**
   - Test Critique Labs if available
   - Ensure British English
   - Verify 2000+ words
