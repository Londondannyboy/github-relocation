# 🚀 RESTART PROMPT - Local Relocation Project

## Quick Start Command
```
I need to continue the local-relocation project at /Users/dankeegan/local-relocation. 
Check CLAUDE.md first - it's the single source of truth.
```

## 🎉 Major Victory Achieved (Sep 30, 2025)

### ✅ 8 APIs Successfully Integrated:
1. **Perplexity** - Query expansion, "People Also Ask" 
2. **LinkUp** - 29+ deep sources with citations
3. **Tavily** - AI synthesis (0.95 scores!) with production key
4. **Critique Labs** - Fact validation working
5. **Claude** - Replaced OpenAI, saving $200/month!
6. **DataForSEO** - Real metrics (volume, CPC, difficulty)
7. **Serper** - SERP features, People Also Ask
8. **Firecrawl** - Official site scraping (v1 endpoint)

### 📊 Key Achievements:
- **Tiered Routing**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW value detection working
- **Cost Tracking**: $0.02-0.03 per HIGH VALUE article
- **Keyword Clustering**: Perplexity expands 1 keyword → 10+ queries
- **Tracking Schema**: postTracking in Sanity for full transparency
- **Cache System**: Ready for Firecrawl optimization

### 🔑 All API Keys Configured in .env.local:
```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=✅ Configured
LINKUP_API_KEY=✅ Configured
TAVILY_API_KEY=✅ Configured (Production key!)
CRITIQUE_API_KEY=✅ Configured
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=✅ Configured
DATAFORSEO_LOGIN=✅ Configured
DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD=✅ Configured
SERPER_API_KEY=✅ Configured
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=✅ Configured
```

## 📁 Key Files to Check:
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Single source of truth (UPDATED with victory!)
2. **TRACKING.md** - Shows API usage and costs
3. **research-agent.js** - Has all 8 APIs integrated
4. **copywriter-agent.js** - Claude integration started (needs completion)
5. **postTracking.ts** - Sanity schema for tracking

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions:

### 1. Generate First Article with Full Stack
```bash
node scripts/agents/orchestrate-agents.js "Portugal Golden Visa 2025" "Golden Visa Programs"
```

### 2. Verify All APIs Are Called
Check that PRD shows:
- LinkUp: 29+ sources
- Tavily: 0.95+ relevance score
- Critique: Validation results
- Total Cost: ~$0.02-0.03

### 3. Publish with Tracking
The article should create both:
- A `post` document in Sanity
- A `postTracking` document showing all API usage

## 🚨 Important Notes:

### What's Working:
- Research Agent with 8 APIs ✅
- Tiered routing based on keyword value ✅
- Cost tracking and transparency ✅
- Keyword clustering via Perplexity ✅

### What Needs Completion:
- Finish replacing OpenAI with Claude in copywriter-agent.js
- Implement Firecrawl caching system
- Test full pipeline end-to-end with publishing

### Context Limitations:
- If context gets full, restart and reference this document
- Always check CLAUDE.md first - it has the latest status
- The project has 999 existing posts that need quality improvement

## 🏆 The Vision Achieved:
"Massive advantage in creating high-quality content that's hard to beat"
- From 1-2 tools → 8 orchestrated APIs
- From generic content → 29+ sources with citations
- From blind generation → Full cost and usage transparency
- From single keywords → Keyword clusters (10x coverage)

## Test Command to Verify Everything:
```bash
# Test all APIs individually
node scripts/test-apis.js

# Run full research pipeline
node scripts/agents/research-agent.js "Portugal Golden Visa 2025"

# Generate complete article
node scripts/agents/orchestrate-agents.js "Portugal Golden Visa 2025" "Golden Visa Programs"
```
