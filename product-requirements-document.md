## üö® LESSONS LEARNED & NEW RULES

### What Went Wrong
1. **Single Category Trap**: All articles in one category
2. **No Research Phase**: Skipped competitive analysis
3. **Generic Content**: No unique insights or angles
4. **Poor Formatting**: Walls of text, no breaks
5. **Unused APIs**: Perplexity never called

### New Rules
1. **ALWAYS use Three-Agent System**
2. **ALWAYS assign multiple categories**
3. **ALWAYS do competitive research first**
4. **ALWAYS format for readability**
5. **ALWAYS include unique insights**
6. **NEVER skip the research phase**
7. **NEVER publish generic content**

## üìù IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

```bash
1. Create Three-Agent scripts:
   - scripts/agents/research-agent.js
   - scripts/agents/copywriter-agent.js
   - scripts/agents/editor-agent.js
   - scripts/agents/orchestrate-agents.js

2. Fix existing content:
   - Redistribute categories properly
   - Consolidate duplicate content
   - Improve formatting

3. Test new system:
   - Run 5-10 articles through pipeline
   - Measure quality improvements

**REMEMBER**: We have 999 articles but they need quality improvement. Focus on:
1. Fixing categorization (97% in single category)
2. Adding unique insights and research
3. Improving formatting and readability
4. Implementing Three-Agent System for future content
5. Quality over quantity - better 100 great articles than 1000 generic ones
